I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College (PUMC)](http://www.cams.ac.cn/), where I work in the [Long Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/erping-long-lab/). I received my Master’s degree in Surgery from [Tianjin Medical University](https://gs.tmu.edu.cn/) in 2024 and my Bachelor’s degree in Clinical Medicine from [Jining Medical University](https://www.jnmc.edu.cn/) in 2021. My long-term goal is to apply artificial intelligence to clinical medicine, enabling everyone to benefit from safe and accessible AI-powered healthcare.

Currently, I focus on **large language models (LLMs) for medical applications**. Our recent work discussed the challenges of deploying LLMs in real-world medical settings ([Clinical and Translational Medicine, 2025](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ctm2.70157)).

In parallel, I also work on **single-cell omics and spatial transcriptomics**. We developed a genetic algorithm–optimized framework to map the metabolic landscape of lung adenocarcinoma ([Journal of Translational Medicine, 2024](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-024-05138-2)), and created an online prognostic platform for lung cancer ([appLUAD](https://xintisunlab.shinyapps.io/appLUAD/)).
